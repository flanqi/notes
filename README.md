## Introduction
This is a personal repository for notes. It consists of coding that is commonly used in data science, ranging from data manipulation, visualization to machine learning algorithms. It serves as a dictionary that facillitates personal lookups in Python, R and SQL.

## How to use the notes
The markdown notes usually start with a `Table of Contents` section, broken down by categories like data manipulation, types of ML algorithms, etc. 

At each subsection, sometimes there will be a button on the right `↥ back to top` that helps you get back to the top of the page to possibly switch a different section using the table of contents section. 

For each subsection, if the same topic exists in notes of another language, you will also see `⇄ language` button to help you switch to the corresponding section in the notes of the specified language.
